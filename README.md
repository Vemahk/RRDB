# Relational Records Database

Because SQL is dumb.

Allow me to explain myself...

## Intepreted Languages

Are awful.

## Rust

... is a language which attempts to go out of its way to force you to design the program correctly but in such a way where it is also able to help you do it. Wonderful, right? I wish we had the same thing in the land of Databases.

SQL is a highly flexible specification. I do not *want* a highly flexible specification. I want a specification that encourages me to create things in the right way, discourages me from making things the wrong way, makes it easy for me to do things correctly, and makes it difficult for me to do things wrongly.

## Moral Subjectivism

Wait, how'd we get here? "How can you make a claim as to what is 'right' and 'wrong' in every circumstance? There are a lot of problems out there that can only be solved by the flexibility of SQL!"

I'm not convinced that is true. I think the flexibility of SQL is certainly convenient, especially when you want to Proof-of-Concept something, but I do not thing that all of the features of the SQL language are *necessary* to solve certain problems. Just like BrainF\*\*\* is a Turing-complete language, but why would you *ever* want to program in it?

## Normalization

Despite my woes against SQL itself, I am not so woeful of the idea of Relational Databases.

Let me stop right there - I do not believe RDBMS's are the solution to *all* of my persistance problems. Far from it, actually: I think an RDBMS's role *ought* to be relatively small (compared to the diversity of persistence problems you are likely to encounter creating production software).

However, NoSQL is not the solution to *all* of your problems, *either*. Just like RDBMS, it has its place.

## ORMs

My idea does not differ entirely from ORMs, except that ORMs just abstract away SQL, and it SQL I take issue with.

# Do you actually intend to replace SQL?

No, not really. I just had an idea, and I really enjoy to program. This realistically isn't actually going anywhere. I just like you dream, you know?
